      <br />
        Ingredients<br />
        <br /><br />
        <br />
        1 medium seedless watermelon, chilled
        <br />
        2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
        <br />
        1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
        <br />
        1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
        <br />
        1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
        <br />
        1/2 cup crumbled feta
        <br />
        1/3 cup minced onion
        <br />
        1/4 cup finely chopped mint, plus more for garnish if desired

        <br />
        Directions
        <br />
        <br />watermelon squares topped with red onion, feta, and mint Trim each
        end off the watermelon and stand it up vertically. Run a knife along the
        line of where the rind meets the flesh to remove the rind. Trim the
        sides of the peeled watermelon to create 4 straight sides and save the
        trimmings for another use. Cut the straight sided watermelon into about
        2 dozen 2 inch chunks. Use a melon baller or small spoon to hollow out
        about 2 teaspoons of flesh from the center of each watermelon cube and
        save for later use. Place hollowed watermelon on a serving platter and
        set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, salt and
        pepper. Add feta, onion and mint to the dressing mixture and fold gently
        to combine. Spoon feta mixture into the watermelon cubes and garnish
        with extra fresh mint if desired.

        <br>
        1 1/2 cups blueberries
        <br>
        3 tbsp honey
        <br>
        1/2 cup orange juice, divided
        <br>
        1 tbsp cornstarch
        <br>  <br>
        
        Directions  <br>  <br>
        Make the waffles: In a medium bowl, whisk together milk and egg yolks. Stir in flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in melted butter and let stand for about 30 minutes.
        <br>
        Lightly grease and preheat a waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.
